					<p>This text forms the basis of a <em>choose your own adventure</em>–style game. It updates an old template by Superstudio.<span id="footnote-1-reference" class="footnote-reference" data-index="1">1</span> Players will move across this map in a mixed-reality scenario, while figuring out how to navigate the fragmented and disconnected archipelago of post-pandemic art worlds. In this game, art-worlding is transformed into a world-building activity. As a first step, read the descriptions of the twenty-one existing art worlds below and decide how many of them have become obsolete and need to be composted for the sake of being recycled and resurrected into something else. Depending on the number you choose, you will then discover what type of art-worlder you are at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2><strong>First Art World: The Carnivore Art World </strong></h2>

<p>The participants</p>
<p>Dream and die, eaten alive</p>

<p>Art world victims are</p>

<p>Consisting of an excavating apparatus [footnote In the most disfigured, listless, and numb area of that real estate that once was New York, and, more precisely, where MoMA once was at about 83rd Street, this art world is incorporated as a cluster of shell entities. The structure is a 3D hologram with a length, width, and height of 180 feet, consisting of ready-made junkspace cubicles, in each of which there is a lens nine inches in diameter. This structure contains shell cubicles which in turn contain cubicles in an infinite regress. Inside the cubicles, bureaucratic rituals take place under the pretext of child abuse. This activity sustains this art world, but actually, no one in the world understands its arcane, toxic, and superstitious nature. The metabolism of this structure is performed by Picasso and Cezanne artworks circulating in between the shells, fueled by energized impunity. Systems of incorporated art advisories inserted in various points of the shell cluster enable them to communicate directly. At the center of the art world is a shell. On the ground level, a series of gates lead to a labyrinth of rooms, corridors, staircases, and basements. The building is completely sealed off from the outside reality. The whole building is one huge maze.] (a kind of turbine, with blades) that, in revolving, crushes rock, forcing all matter towards the center of the cylinder and through a duct up to the ground. The art world happens when new contingents of participants are led underground using the winding screw as a pathway. The procession into the underworld is arranged at 6:00 p.m., and a choreography dictates a precise sequence of movements which participants have to execute, each imitating a small personal robot walking next to them. The traces they leave behind, slime, blood, and other biological fluids, are photographed, censored, and broadcast over a network as a QR code. Once the participants in the procession reach the bottom, they fall asleep and dream of an entirely different art world. They awake refreshed and then are eaten alive by the art world to sustain itself. An orifice 7.22 meters in diameter opens up temporarily on the level below participants. Their biological matter is digested by the machine while their dreams are marketed on some Discord channel. The carnivore art world is constantly creating new images and objects, and reproducing itself.</p>

<p>Public shaming feasts</p>

Its modules are adorned with elements obtained through robbery, plunder, and forgery. On a quiet day, it basks in the ocean sunlight, which is artificially constrained by tele-operated modules of steel painted yellow. At its center stands a dome ten meter in diameter and a hundred meters tall, from which a putrefying odor emerges every two years. At this sign, participants start descending onto the art world. A feast is held for a period of many months. Its purpose is the playtesting of new modes of oppression. To this extent, participants crown temporary royalty and cancel all others. The public shaming and humiliation are recorded on the Solana blockchain and auctioned off. Famous people die in this art world: they come to study its rituals, but then the art world takes its revenge and kills them by eating their guts. As the public playtesting is taking place, the art world becomes a big circus with an outer ring and an inner one, connected by nonfunctional elevators and Ferris wheels.</p>

Every year, a growing number of people are executed under the suspicion to have harbored thoughts about the <em>P</em>-word<em>.</em> They are first ritually thrown into debt, symbolically eradicated by numbering their due in shame coins, and then have to confess. A conveyor belt grabs them and strips them of any remaining data. They can return now to the overground but as a sort of virtual leper. In this world, special forms of madness are known. The most persistent plague is the roletarian fever, followed by the recarious rash. People who get infected are interned into huge quarantine facilities, shut in, and forgotten about. This art world is based on strict laws, which are only made clear in case of an emergency.[footnote In the most disfigured, listless, and numb area of that real estate that once was New York, and, more precisely, where MoMA once was at about 83rd Street, this art world is incorporated as a cluster of shell entities.
